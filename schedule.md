## Day1
- Introduction 
  - Intro to workshop, DAC, and personal intros.
- Introduction to bioinformatics lecture 
- Fred sequencing lecture (45 min with time for discussion?)
- Common file formats for bioinformatics
  - FASTA and FASTQ (exercises for manipulating these files)
  - Principles of alignments and BAM/SAM/CRAM 
  - Genomic region files (GTF/GFF, BED, BED+ examples (e.g. narrowPeak format for ChIP-seq))
- Basic scripting (basic bash scripting, submitting jobs to HPC)
- Installing bioinformatics software using a CLI 

## Day2
- Basics of R programming (review)

  - Basic data structures (vector, matrix, list, dataframe)
  - Reading data into R
  - Simple data vis.
  - Installing Packages (CRAN & Bioconductor)
  - Writing data files and figures to files
  - More complicated data struictures anbd specific classes (e.g. S4 objects, summarizedExperiment class as example?)
- Genomic data analysis in R (with Bioconductor)
  - GenomicRanges and operating on genomic intervals in R 
  - Importing genomic file types into R (example with a BED file into a GenomicRanges object)
  - Reference genomes and genome annotations
  - Extracting sequences from a reference genome using GenomicRanges objects  
- IGV tutorial

## Day 3
- Using R on an HPC 
  - Running jobs interactively while using a text editor 
  - Submitting R jobs on Discovery 
- Statistics and bioinformatics
- Wrap -up/closing remarks





# Schedule 

We will try our best to stick to this schedule, although it is a best guess. We may (likely) deviate from this dependning on how we are doing for time as we progress. We understand that you may have other commitments and may not be able to be present 100% of the time. 

Please let us know if you expect to be absent from any sessions, so that we know to move forward without you.
