# Basic programming with R

R is a free, open source programming language and statistical software environment that is used extensively in bioinformatics. In addition to the large collection of functions included in base distribution, there are an enormous number of packages designed to extend R's functionality for specific applications. 

R is also a very powerful way to create high quality graphics, using both functionality in base R as well as graphics specific packages such as [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). These packages provide a high level of user control, meaning almost all plotting features can be controlled. Importantly, numerous R packages provide functionality for generating bioinformatics specific visualizations.
