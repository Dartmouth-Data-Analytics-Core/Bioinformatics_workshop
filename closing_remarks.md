# Closing remarks

### Workshop goals: 
- Develop a working understanding what Bioinformatic data analysis involves, how it is done, and what skills it requires  
- Gain an appreciation for how next-generation sequencing data is generated (NGS) and how the information generated is stored   
- Learn the major file-types used in bioinformatic data analysis and how to manipulate them   
- Learn how to install standard bioinformatic software using Conda   
- Understand the concepts of reference genomes and genome annotations and where to find them  
Learn how to leverage the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) for exploring genomics data    
- Gain a working knowledge of basic programming in R and how it can be used for Bioinformatics  
- Understand the basic principles for statistical learning and inference as they apply to bioinformatics  
- Learn how to leverage high performance computing systems (HPCs) to perform Bioinformatic data-analysis

### Some final take-aways from the workshop:
- Spend the time to plan, consult, practice, (and money) to generate high quality data that will provide robust inferences 
- If you are going to do a lot of Bioinformatics, you should get **really** good at the command-line (Bash), otherwise, pre-processing will be slow & painful
- Seek out the appropriate level fo statistical training for the analyses you want to conduct independently




### How to consolidate your learning: 
- Re-run the code a week or two after the workshop, as this is a great way to consolidate what you have learned at the command-line
- Edit the code, run sub-sections, read the `man` pages for commands, etc. to build a solid understanding of how everything works
- 



 



### Feedback: 

We ask that you all complete the survey that has been sent out over email so that we can gauge what worked well and what we need to improve for our next workshop. If you have additional thoughts that were not addressed in the survey, please feel free to contact any one of us, or reach out to the DAC meail directly (*DataAnalyticsCore@groups.dartmouth.edu*).

We plan to offer this workshop again, in addition to two RNA-seq specific workshops:
- Data pre-processing & quality control for RNA-seq 
- Differential expression analysis for RNA-seq 

If you have suggestions for workshops you would like to see in the future, please let us know! 

Please feel free to reach out to us with questions about concepts discussed in the workshop, or for a analysis consultations. Our **bioinformatics office hours** on **Fridays 1-2pm** are a great place to do this! (currently on zoom: https://dartmouth.zoom.us/s/96998379866, pword: *bioinfo*)

### Now.... discussion/questions!
